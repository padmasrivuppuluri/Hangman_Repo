# Hangman_Repo
## Project Description:
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

### Task1:
Created a list variable for fruits.
Printed a random fruit from the list and assigned it to the word variable.

### Task2:
Created two functions: ask_for_input() and check_guess().
ask_for_input():
Prompts the user to enter a single letter.
If the input is not a single letter, it displays an error message.
Validates that the input is exactly one character long and is an alphabetical letter.
check_guess():
Checks if the entered letter is present in the word (fruit) stored in the word variable.
